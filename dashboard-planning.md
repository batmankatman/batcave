4. **Scheduling decisions** - Provide data for realistic time estimates via *potential availability windows*
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Category Time Distribution**: Percentage breakdown across activity categories (Work, Routine, Social, etc.)
- **Productivity Ratios**: Productive time vs. leisure time ratios
- **Sleep Consistency**: Average sleep duration and bedtime variance
- **Time Inefficiency Indicators**: Low-priority activity time (e.g., excessive social or fun/personal activities)
- **Weekly Trend Analysis**: Changes in time allocation patterns over weeks
- **Availability Windows**: Free time slots available for new commitments
- **Efficiency Rank**: Aggregated productivity effectiveness score
### What the audience wants:
- **Clear visual summaries** of where time is being spent
- **Actionable insights** for schedule optimization
- **Comparison tools** to track improvement over time
