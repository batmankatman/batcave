          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Many have searched for a strong, organized schedule to tell them what to do, but what about the schedule that occurred last week: Did it transpire how we imagined it to? What about the week before? The semester? Does anything go along with our schedule? Hopefully most thing, but how about measuring with precision the statements like, ‚ÄúI should be able to make it this weekend‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat project took me all day‚Äù, and pick apart the verity of statements like ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have time.‚Äù Whilst confidently promising other exchanges like ‚ÄúBro, I‚Äôll be open after work this weekend,‚Äù I got pretty tired of overestimating my availability. Thus, <strong>the goal of this project is to give a strong glimpse into <em>how much availability</em> we really have</strong> in the day and through the week (based on our regular time for non-negotiables like routine, work, and school as well as negotiable like personal time, socializing, and spontaneous pockets).</p>
          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>This project analyzes personal time tracking data covering 8 weeks (4 pairs of two-week periods) of comprehensive activity logging from waking to sleeping hours. The analysis processes raw time-stamped activity logs and generates detailed metrics, visualizations, and qualitative reports.</p>
          <p><em>*Definitely was undergirded by my artificially intelligent friend named Claude in making these visualizations for my project ‚≠êÔ∏è</em></p>

          <h2>Data Structure</h2>
          
          <h3>Time Tracking Format</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple</strong>: Activities logged with military time timestamps (HHMM format)</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive</strong>: Complete daily coverage from wake-up to sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Thorough</strong>: 8 total weeks of data</li>
            <li><strong>Organized</strong>: Sequential daily segments with header information for each day</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Activity Categories</h3>
          <p>The system uses a structured categorization approach with the following primary categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GOD</strong>: Spiritual and religious activities</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong>: Program/academic work</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>: Routine activities</li>
            <li><strong>E</strong>: Exercise and physical activities</li>
            <li><strong>S</strong>: Social interactions and communication</li>
            <li><strong>F</strong>: Fun and recreational activities</li>
            <li><strong>W</strong>: Workout and exercise</li>
            <li><strong>LO</strong>: Sleep/lights out marker</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Measurement Methodology</h2>
          
          <h3>Time Calculation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Activities are measured in <strong>minutes</strong> with automatic duration calculation</li>
            <li>Durations computed based on timestamp intervals between consecutive entries</li>
            <li>Midnight crossovers handled automatically</li>
            <li>Sleep periods calculated from LO markers to day-end boundaries</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data Processing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>5-minute time slots</strong>: Complete timeline broken into 5-minute increments</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly aggregation</strong>: Data grouped into sequential 7-day blocks</li>
            <li><strong>Category totals</strong>: Time spent per category tracked across all periods</li>
            <li><strong>Quality validation</strong>: Automatic detection and flagging of timestamp inconsistencies</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Visualizations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grouped charts</strong>: Stacked bar charts showing daily hours across 7-day periods</li>
            <li><strong>Category breakdown</strong>: Visual representation of patterns in how time is allocated across categories</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly progression</strong>: Tracking changes in activity patterns over time</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Metrics Tracked</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Total time per category across all weeks</li>
            <li>Weekly category distributions</li>
            <li>Daily activity patterns</li>
            <li>Sleep vs. awake time </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="project-visualization">
            <h2>Analysis Results</h2>
            <p>The comprehensive analysis generated multiple visualizations to understand time allocation patterns across the 8-week tracking period:</p>
            
            <p>I have chosen these charts in order to find out some of these indicators of non-intuitive time spending because as you'll see some of these graphs do not reflect what I think (and possibly what you would think) is where your time and your day goes. So let's find out. üòé</p>
            
            <div class="analysis-chart">
              <img src="graphs1.png" alt="Time Tracking Analysis Graph 1" class="project-image" />
              <p class="chart-description"> Ever wondered how much time you actually spend on your homework versus your time you spend in the classroom? *they say you should spend two hours outside the classroom as you do inside the classroom...*.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-chart">
              <img src="graphs2.png" alt="Time Tracking Analysis Graph 2" class="project-image" />
              <p class="chart-description">Here it is plain, and simple.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-chart">
              <img src="graphs3.png" alt="Time Tracking Analysis Graph 3" class="project-image" />
              <p class="chart-description">Here's the week split! A little too much routine... I promise, I don't have that much routine. (Note that *routine* includes driving, walking, getting ready for the morning or night, and the facilties üòâ).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-chart">
              <img src="graphs4.png" alt="Time Tracking Analysis Graph 4" class="project-image" />
              <p class="chart-description">Now you can see each bar representing a different activity category, making it easier to compare time spent across various tasks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-chart">
              <img src="graphs5.png" alt="Time Tracking Analysis Graph 5" class="project-image" />
              <p class="chart-description">I still don't know that this graph is proportionate to the previous one... But you get the idea.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-chart">
              <img src="graphs6.png" alt="Time Tracking Analysis Graph 6" class="project-image" />
              <p class="chart-description">Just for demonstration--this is the struggle of making your own dtaset! This is how I catch anomalies, because I'm pretty sure I didn't spend *36 hours on Routine in a single day*....</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>So there you have it that's where *my* time went, and I sure do spend a lot more time doing the routine things, even though I thought that that was one of my strongest categories of reduction‚Ä¶ But, I give myself the benefit of the doubt that perhaps I have some more data cleaning to do, or I just have to accept the fact that I am high maintenance :( I am quite interested in caging the best ways to be productive and so I actually hope to take this program to apply it to other people who will observe their own time or, *if they're willing*, I can track it for them. And overall, we can become more time cognizant, and seeing how we spend our time and carefully choose our days wisely.</p>
