          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Many have searched for a strong, organized schedule to tell them what to do, but what about the schedule that occurred last week: Did it transpire how we imagined it to? What about the week before? The semester? Does anything go along with our schedule? Hopefully most thing, but how about measuring with precision the statements like, ‚ÄúI should be able to make it this weekend‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat project took me all day‚Äù, and pick apart the verity of statements like ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have time.‚Äù Whilst confidently promising other exchanges like ‚ÄúBro, I‚Äôll be open after work this weekend,‚Äù I got pretty tired of overestimating my availability. Thus, <strong>the goal of this project is to give a strong glimpse into <em>how much availability</em> we really have</strong> in the day and through the week (based on our regular time for non-negotiables like routine, work, and school as well as negotiable like personal time, socializing, and spontaneous pockets).</p>
          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>This project analyzes personal time tracking data covering 8 weeks (4 pairs of two-week periods) of comprehensive activity logging from waking to sleeping hours. The analysis processes raw time-stamped activity logs and generates detailed metrics, visualizations, and qualitative reports.</p>

          <h2>Data Structure</h2>
          
          <h3>Time Tracking Format</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple</strong>: Activities logged with military time timestamps (HHMM format)</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive</strong>: Complete daily coverage from wake-up to sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Thorough</strong>: 8 total weeks of data</li>
            <li><strong>Organized</strong>: Sequential daily segments with header information for eac hday</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Activity Categories</h3>
          <p>The system uses a structured categorization approach with the following primary categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GOD</strong>: Spiritual and religious activities</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong>: Program/academic work</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>: Routine activities</li>
            <li><strong>E</strong>: Exercise and physical activities</li>
            <li><strong>S</strong>: Social interactions and communication</li>
            <li><strong>F</strong>: Fun and recreational activities</li>
            <li><strong>W</strong>: Workout and exercise</li>
            <li><strong>LO</strong>: Sleep/lights out marker</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Measurement Methodology</h2>
          
          <h3>Time Calculation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Activities are measured in <strong>minutes</strong> with automatic duration calculation</li>
            <li>Durations computed based on timestamp intervals between consecutive entries</li>
            <li>Midnight crossovers handled automatically</li>
            <li>Sleep periods calculated from LO markers to day-end boundaries</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data Processing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>5-minute time slots</strong>: Complete timeline broken into 5-minute increments</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly aggregation</strong>: Data grouped into sequential 7-day blocks</li>
            <li><strong>Category totals</strong>: Time spent per category tracked across all periods</li>
            <li><strong>Quality validation</strong>: Automatic detection and flagging of timestamp inconsistencies</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Visualizations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sequential block charts</strong>: Stacked bar charts showing daily hours across 7-day periods</li>
            <li><strong>Category breakdown</strong>: Visual representation of patterns in how time is allocated across categories</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly progression</strong>: Tracking changes in activity patterns over time</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Metrics Tracked</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Total time per category across all weeks</li>
            <li>Weekly category distributions</li>
            <li>Daily activity patterns</li>
            <li>Sleep vs. awake time ratios</li>
            <li>Activity transition</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Analysis Results</h2>
            <p>The comprehensive analysis generated multiple visualizations to understand time allocation patterns across the 8-week tracking period:</p>

          <p>I have chosen these charts in order to find out some of these indicators of non-intuitive time spending because as you'll see some of these graphs do not reflect what I think (and possibly what you would think) is where your time and your day goes. So let's find out. üòé</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>A lot of the code and graph generation worked, but there were so many anomalies and they're still just a couple left in the data that were hard to clean out, and that I will clean out for project 2. I would definitely change about this to clean all of my code 1st thoroughly and it's OK if some miss but this is a necessary step for any data scientist. üòú</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <h2>Technical Report</h2>
          <p>The complete data processing pipeline is implemented in Python, handling everything from raw data ingestion to visualization generation. The script processes time-stamped activity logs, performs data validation, and generates comprehensive analytics.</p>
